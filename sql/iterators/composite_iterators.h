/**
  @file composite_iterators.h

  A composite row iterator is one that takes in one or more existing iterators
  and processes their rows in some interesting way. They are usually not bound
  to a single table or similar, but are the inner (non-leaf) nodes of the
  iterator execution tree. They consistently own their source iterator, although
  not its memory (since we never allocate row iterators on the heap--usually on
  a MEM_ROOT>). This means that in the end, you'll end up with a single root
  iterator which then owns everything else recursively.

  SortingIterator and the two window iterators are also composite iterators,
  but are defined in their own files.

/**
  Handles aggregation (typically used for GROUP BY) for the case where the rows
  are already properly grouped coming in, ie., all rows that are supposed to be
  part of the same group are adjacent in the input stream. (This could be
  because they were sorted earlier, because we are scanning an index that
  already gives us the rows in a group-compatible order, or because there is no
  grouping.)

  AggregateIterator needs to be able to save and restore rows; it doesn't know
  when a group ends until it's seen the first row that is part of the _next_
  group. When that happens, it needs to tuck away that next row, and then
  restore the previous row so that the output row gets the correct grouped
  values. A simple example, doing SELECT a, SUM(b) FROM t1 GROUP BY a:

    t1.a  t1.b                                       SUM(b)
     1     1     <-- first row, save it                1
     1     2                                           3
     1     3                                           6
     2     1     <-- group changed, save row
    [1     1]    <-- restore first row, output         6
                     reset aggregate              -->  0
    [2     1]    <-- restore new row, process it       1
     2    10                                          11
                 <-- EOF, output                      11

  To save and restore rows like this, it uses the infrastructure from
  pack_rows.h to pack and unpack all relevant rows into record[0] of every input
  table. (Currently, there can only be one input table, but this may very well
  change in the future.) It would be nice to have a more abstract concept of
  sending a row around and taking copies of it if needed, as opposed to it
  implicitly staying in the table's buffer. (This would also solve some
  issues in EQRefIterator and when synthesizing NULL rows for outer joins.)
  However, that's a large refactoring.

  Contains spill state for set operations' use of in-memory hash map.

  If we encounter a situation in which the hash map for set operations
  overflows allowed memory, we initiate a spill to disk procedure. This class
  encapsulates state using during this procedure. Spill to disk starts
  with a call to \c handle_hash_map_full.

  We built a mechanism with an in-memory hash map which can spill
  gracefully to disk if the volume of rows gets large and still perform
  well. In the presence of wrong table cardinality information, we may not be
  able to complete the spill to disk procedure (if we still run out of memory
  when hashing chunks, see below). If so, we fall back on de-duplicating
  using the non-unique key of the output (materialized) result table.

  The spill code is partially based on code developed for hash join: e.g. we
  reuse packing/unpacking functions like
  \verbatim
    StoreFromTableBuffersRaw            (pack_rows.h)
    LoadImmutableStringIntoTableBuffers (hash_join_buffer.h)
  \endverbatim
  and furthermore, the Robin Hood hashing library (robin_hood.h), and the chunk
  file abstraction.
  \verbatim
  Definitions:
        A' - set of rows from operand 1 of set operation that fits in
             the in-memory hash map, deduplicated, with counters
        A  - set of rows from operand 1 before deduplication
        B  - non-deduplicated set of rows from operand 1 that didn't
             fit
        C = A + B
           - total set of rows in operand one; not known a priori, but we use
             the statistics for an estimate.

        M - (aka. m_num_chunks) total number of chunk files the tertiary
            hash distributes the rows to. Multiple of 2, as used for hash join.

        N - (aka. HashJoinIterator::kMaxChunks) the max number of HF and IF
             files that may be open at one time. May be smaller than M.

        S = ceiling(M/N)  (aka. m_no_of_chunk_file_sets)
           - number of sets of open files we need

        s - the set of chunk files opened (aka. m_chunk_files), sets are
            enumerated from 0..S-1, cf. m_current_chunk_file_set.

        n - number of operands in set operation

        REMAININGINPUT (aka. m_remaining_input) - tmp file needed if S > 1.
        MATERIALIZEDTABLE (aka. m_materialized_table) - output for
            EXCEPT/INTERSECT algorithm

        primary hash
          - MySQL record hash, aka. calc_row_hash(m_materialized_table)
        secondary hash
          - the hash function used by Robin Hood for the in-memory hash map
            based on primary hash
        tertiary hash
          - hash function for distributing rows to chunk files, cf.

                           |       | rows from set 0
                           +-------+
                               :
                           +-------+
                           |       | rows from set S-1
                           +-------+

  If we need more M than N, M will be a multiple of N as well as a multiple of
  2, since N is also chosen a multiple of two (currently 128). So, the physical
  tmp file contains several logical chunk files. For the HF chunks, we in
  addition have several generations of these: each round of processing appends
  a new generation (more updated) version of the chunks. For a 2 operand set
  operation, we have three generations:

  1. the initial row sets from the in-memory hash map (A' spread over M chunks)
  2. updated sets with the rest of the left operand (C deduplicated and spread
     over M chunks)
  3. updated sets after we have processed the right operand

  We keep track of the read and write positions on the tmp files, cf. methods
  HashJoinChunk::SetAppend and HashJoinChunk::ContinueRead. This enables
  reading back rows from the generation last written, and the writing of a new
  generation at the tail of the chunk file. More set operands than two adds
  further generations, one for each extra operand.

  * Algorithm


  1. The in-memory hash map can hit its memory limit when we read the
     left set operand (block) after having read A rows, resulting in A' rows in
     in-memory hash map. If we do not hit the limit, we are done, no spill to
     disk is required.

     Note: Spill can never happen when we read operand 2..n since operand 1 of
     INTERSECT and EXCEPT determines the maximum rows in the result set and
     hence the maximal size of the in-memory hash map.

     So, we will have established the spill-over storage *before* reading of
     operands 2..n starts.

  2. Before looking at operand 2..n, we need to finish processing the remaining
     rows in the left operand, cf. the details below:

  3. When we hit limit, we:

     Determine number N of chunk files based on the estimated number of rows in
     operand 1 (the left operand). As mentioned, if number of chunks needed (M)
     > maxOpenFiles, we still allow this but will keep open only a subset s at
     any one time, presuming worst case of no deduplication, i.e. A'==A.  In
     this case, M == N * S, but M can be as low as 2 (M << N). This is
     performed in the method `compute_chunk_file_sets' and
     `initialize_first_HF_chunk_files'.

   3.a)
        For all file sets s in 1..S:

           - rehash with tertiary hash and write A' to files HF-{0..N-1} all
             rows in in-mem hash map. Save the computed primary hash value in
             the hash column, so we do not need to compute it over again when
             we read HF-k into hash map again. This is done in method
             `spread_hash_map_to_HF_chunk_files'. HF chunk file sets are now
             in generation one.

           - When s contains hash for offending row, write the offending row
             |A|+1 that did't fit the in-memory hash map to IF-k in s.
             (aka. m_offending_row)

        Note these rows (A') have been de-duplicated down to A' and
        counters set accordingly.


     3.b)
        For all file sets s in 1..S:

        3.b.1) read the rest of the left input (or re-read them via
               REMAININGINPUT if s>1), hash and write to destination file IF-k
               the rows which, based on its tertiary hash value, have index k
               in the current set.  If s is the first file set AND S>1 and row
               didn't go to a file in s, also save input row to file
               REMAININGINPUT since we need it for another file set (since we
               cannot replay the source). See method
               `save_rest_of_operand_to_IF_chunk_files' and
               `reset_for_spill_handling'.

     At this point we have the rest of the input rows B (that that have not
     been matched against HFs) in IF-{0..N-1}.  HF rows already are unique and
     have set operation counters already set based on first part of input rows
     that did fit in memory (so we have no need to "remember" that part of
     input except as initialized counters): only the remaining input rows (from
     operand 1) are of concern to us now.

     From here on, the logic is driven from the read_next_row. The set counter
     logic is still handled by process_row_hash. Most of the machinery
     for reading, writing and switching chunk files are driven by a state
     machine from read_next_row, (almost) invisible to
     process_row_hash, except for a simplified handling when we
     re-enter HF rows into the hash map ready to process operand 2..n, cf. call
     to `load_HF_row_into_hash_map': these rows have already been
     de-duplicated and the hash table will not grow in size compared to
     operand one (intersect and except can't increase result set size), so we
     can use a shorter logic path.

     3.c)
        For each s in 1..S do
        For each pair of {HF-k, IF-k} in s do
           3.c.1) Read HF-k into hash map: optimization: use saved hash value
                  Cf. ReadingState::SS_READING_LEFT_HF

           3.c.2) Read rows from IF-k, continuing hash processing of
                  operand one. Cf. ReadingState::SS_READING_LEFT_IF.

                  If hash map overflows here, we recover by changing to
                  de-duplicating via the tmp table (we re-initialize it with a
                  non-unique index on the hash field in the row in
                  handle_hash_map_full).  This overflow means we cannot fit
                  even 1/M-th of set of unique rows in input set of operand 1
                  in memory). If row estimates are reasonably good, it should
                  not happen.  For details on secondary overflow recovery, see
                  handle_hash_map_full and comments in materialize_hash_map,
                  and logic in read_next_row_secondary_overflow.

           3.c.3) We are done with pair {HF-k, IF-k}, append hash map to HF-k
                  and empty in-memory hash map, cf. `append_hash_map_to_HF'.

      We are done with operand 1, and we have min(M,N) HF files with unique rows
      (incl counters) on disk in one or more sets, in generation two.

     4.a) For each operand 2..n do
        4.a.0) Empty all IFs and REMAININGINPUT.
        For each s in S do

           4.a.1) Read input operand (from block or REMAININGINPUT if s>1),
                  hash to IF-k, and write. If s==1 AND S>1 also save input row
                  to file REMAININGINPUT since we need them for the next file
                  set s, cf. save_operand_to_IF_chunk_files.
           4.a.2) Similar to same as 3.c, except with right side counter logic
                  cf. states ReadingState::SS_READING_RIGHT_{HF,IF}.

     5) We now have min(N,M) HF files with unique rows sets (incl set logic
        counters) on disk (generation three), all operands have been
        processed. For each HF-k read it and write to MATERIALIZEDTABLE.

/**
  Like semijoin materialization, weedout works on the basic idea that a semijoin
  is just like an inner join as we long as we can get rid of the duplicates
  somehow. (This is advantageous, because inner joins can be reordered, whereas
  semijoins generally can't.) However, unlike semijoin materialization, weedout
  removes duplicates after the join, not before it. Consider something like

    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN ( SELECT b FROM t2 );

  Semijoin materialization solves this by materializing t2, with deduplication,
  and then joining. Weedout joins t1 to t2 and then leaves only one output row
  per t1 row. The disadvantage is that this potentially needs to discard more
  rows; the (potential) advantage is that we deduplicate on t1 instead of t2.

  Weedout, unlike materialization, works in a streaming fashion; rows are output
  (or discarded) as they come in, with a temporary table used for recording the
  row IDs we've seen before. (We need to deduplicate on t1's row IDs, not its
  contents.) See SJ_TMP_TABLE for details about the table format.

/**
  An iterator that is semantically equivalent to a semijoin NestedLoopIterator
  immediately followed by a RemoveDuplicatesOnIndexIterator. It is used to
  implement the “loose scan” strategy in queries with multiple tables on the
  inside of a semijoin, like

    ... FROM t1 WHERE ... IN ( SELECT ... FROM t2 JOIN t3 ... )

  In this case, the query tree without this iterator would ostensibly look like

    -> Nested loop join
       -> Table scan on t1
       -> Remove duplicates on t2_idx
          -> Nested loop semijoin
             -> Index scan on t2 using t2_idx
             -> Filter (e.g. t3.a = t2.a)
                -> Table scan on t3

  (t3 will be marked as “first match” on t2 when implementing loose scan,
  thus the semijoin.)

  First note that we can't put the duplicate removal directly on t2 in this
  case, as the first t2 row doesn't necessarily match anything in t3, so it
  needs to be above. However, this is wasteful, because once we find a matching
  t2/t3 pair, we should stop scanning t3 until we have a new t2.

  NestedLoopSemiJoinWithDuplicateRemovalIterator solves the problem by doing
  exactly this; it gets a row from the outer side, gets exactly one row from the
  inner side, and then skips over rows from the outer side (_without_ scanning
  the inner side) until its keypart changes.
